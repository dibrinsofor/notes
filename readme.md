A somewhat comprehensive list, with learning notes, of academic papers and books I have read, want to read or am currently reading.  

This content is mostly focused on systems (Databases, Programming Languages, Computer Architecture and Embedded and IoT systems) and every so often, robotics.

**This is nothing more than a _personal_ learning aid.**
