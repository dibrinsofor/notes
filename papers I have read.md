* [Thinking aloud about confusing code: a qualitative investigation of program comprehension and atoms of confusion]() by **Dan Gopstein** et al, 2020.
  This paper probes prior research work on [Atoms of Confusion](https://atomsofconfusion.com/) -- tiny hand-picked code patterns whose outputs are validated and proven to be confusing to programmers -- exploring reasons why programmers may fail to properly evaluate these code samples and futhermore, the correctness of hand-evaluation (self evaluation by programmers) as a study tool. By leveraging a hybrid qualitative study approach (interviews and observations), Gopstein et al presents novel taxonomies to categorize the confusions found among subjects with the code snippets: unfamiliarity, misunderstanding, language transfer, and attention. This paper gives ample context to the results found [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3106237.3106264). [Easy to follow]
